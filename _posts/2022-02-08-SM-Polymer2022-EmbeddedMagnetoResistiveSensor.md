The conductive polymeric composites incorporating carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbonyl iron powder (CIP) have attracted much attention for various sensor applications. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the magneto-sensing property of a CNT-CIP embedded polymer composite is conducted to implement the composite as magneto-sensors. Thus, this study experimentally investigated the magneto-sensing performances of CNT-doped polymeric composites with the addition of CIP in terms of electrical conductivity, sensitivity, repeatability, and response time. First, the CNT-CIP clusters were manufactured and their interactions were analyzed with the zeta potential measurement and SEM observation. Then, the CNT-CIP clusters were embedded into the polymeric composites for the magneto-sensing evaluations. Experiments showed that the CNT contents in the range of percolation threshold (i.e., 0.5% and 0.75%) are optimal values for sensor applications. The addition of CNT 0.5% and 0.75% resulted in a high sensitivity of 7% and a faster response time within 400 ms. Experiment evaluation confirmed a high potential of implementing CNT-CIP composite as magneto-sensors.
